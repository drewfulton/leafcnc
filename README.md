Leaf CNC and Camera Control
Created By Fultonensis Consulting for Benjamin Blonder

This is a lab-based solution to automate capturing high-resolution photographs of leaf veins by capturing multiple images both in the X and Y axes, as well as providing the flexibility of Z axis manipulation or software control for focus stacking.  A Canon DSLR camera will be used with a 100mm macro lens.  Leaf samples will be sandwiched between glass plates, placed on the bed of the machine, and lit from below so only transmitted light will be captured.  Samples will be sized up to roughly 30cm x 30cm. 

This software controls the CNC machine and the camera.
